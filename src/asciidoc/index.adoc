= Overview of OpenESB Standalone

[partintro]
--
OpenESB Standalone or OpenESB SE (for Standalone Edition) is a complete distribution 
of OpenESB that runs in a simple JVM. Not any container is required to run OpenESB SE.
OpenESB has been developed to be a very light but reliable and powerful version 
of OpenESB. In this context, OpenESB Core (OpenESB bus and management framework) 
require less than 100 Mb and starts in less than 5 seconds. OpenESB share its 
source code with the other versions of OpenESB. So you can develop and deploy your 
projects on OpenESB SE in the same way than you do on the other platforms.

OpenESB SE has been designed mainly to make easier its deployment on the cloud 
and on VM farm. Launching OpenESB SE is as easy as starting a simple JVM. 
Production teams will find in OpenESB SE a way to simplify OpenESB deployment 
in a multi-instances mode.

This document is a reference guide to OpenESB Standalone tools and features. If 
you have any requests, comments, or questions on this document, please post them
on the user mailing list or on the support forums at http://openesb-community-forum.794670.n2.nabble.com/[Nabble].

== Setup Guide
This section includes information on how to setup an OpenESB Standalone instance and get it running. 
If you havenâ€™t already, http://build2.open-esb.net:8080/jenkins/view/openesb-runtime/job/openesb-standalone/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/openesb-standalone-packaging/target/openesb-standalone-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip[download] it, and then check the <<openesb-standalone-installation,installation>> docs.

We want to keep things as simple as possible, so you just have to unzip the 
OpenESB SE distribution in a convenient directory. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please be aware that the installation's path should not contain whitespace characters.
====

[NOTE]
====
For the rest of this documentation, we admit that +OPENESB_HOME+ refers to the 
directory containing the OpenESB installation.
====

=== Requirements
OpenESB Standalone is build using Java, and requires at least http://java.com/[Java 6] in order to run. 
The version of Java that will be sued can be set by setting the +JAVA_HOME+ environment variable.

You should check your current Java installation before you begin:
[source,bash,indent=0]

|Property
|Description

|instance.name
|The name of the OpenESB instance.
This will typically create a folder under +OPENESB_HOME/{instance.name}+

|instance.port
|The port used to communicate over JMX which the instance

|http.port
|The HTTP port used to access rest API or web console

|http.enabled
|Flag to enable / disable HTTP components as rest API or web console

=== Rest API
The new rest API to manage your single OpenESB instance is reachable at http://localhost:4848/api

=== Web Console
By default, you can access the web console using your preferred browser at http://localhost:4848/webui/index.html
[IMPORTANT]
====
At this time, the latest part of the url (_/index.html_) is mandatory. Trying to access http://localhost:4848/webui does not work.
So please use the complete url if you want to access the web console.
